# PLP-Site

This is the repository for the website of the education program me and Finn (Jam) are in. (https://plp.seycove.ca)

We thought the site could use a revision, so we thought why not. It'd be smth we could add to our Portfolios.

This uses an MIT License, feel free to use our code. Be a decent human and credit us if you do use it!!
